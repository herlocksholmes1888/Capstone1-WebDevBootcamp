# Hello! Welcome to the first Capstone Project!

This is a very simple website. It was created as a challenge from [The Complete 2023 Web Development Bootcamp](https://www.udemy.com/course/the-complete-web-development-bootcamp/), by Angela Yu.
It is supposed to be a developer's first portifolio.

Minimal CSS was utilized with the image displayed. [Font Awesome](https://fontawesome.com/) provided the icons at the bottom.
